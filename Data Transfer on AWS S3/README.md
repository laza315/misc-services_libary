Data Transfer on AWS Script


This script is designed to facilitate the transfer of data from any server that is accessible via API and stores data in an AWS S3 bucket. The primary purpose is to streamline the process of exporting data from local environments to the specified S3 buckets.

Future enhancements will include automation for exporting data from local environments and support for additional cloud providers such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure.
